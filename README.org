   What is the difference between "Monty Hall Problem" vs
   "Gambler's Fallacy". I usually err to avoid the "Gambler's
   fallacy".
   I have been reading up on Python Asyncio. Though I have not got
   a complete feel of it - though the network application makes
   complete sense. Need to fathom when to apply it as a design
   pattern.
